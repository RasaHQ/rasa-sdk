## [1.10.2] - 2020-06-25

### Bugfixes


* [#220](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-sdk/pull/220): Re-added an `Action endpoint is up and running` log that was removed in Rasa SDK 1.6.0.

## [1.10.1] - 2020-05-11

### Bugfixes


* [#212](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/212): Fix `ActionExecutor` sometimes not loading user-defined actions that inherit from other user-defined ones.

## [1.10.0] - 2020-04-28

### Features


* [#164](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/164): Added new `--auto-reload` CLI argument. When specified, modules containing `Action`
subclasses will be automatically reloaded if they have been modified since the last HTTP
request. By using this, one can avoid having to re-start the actions server when
developing new actions.


* [#3765](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/3765): Add support for entities with role and group labels.

  If you use `from_entity` in your custom slot mapping, you can now also specify a role and group label.
  If you set a role or group label, the slot is only filled if the entity has the specific role or group label set.
  If you don’t specify a role or group label, the function behaves as before.

### Improvements


* [#176](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/176): The Rasa SDK image now uses Python 3.7 instead of Python 3.6.

### Bugfixes


* [#176](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/176): Updated `pyyaml` dependency to `5.3.1` to fix
[CVE-2020-1747](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1747)

## [1.9.0] - 2020-03-24

### Bugfixes


* [#110](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/110): Exit program (`python -m rasa_sdk --actions actions` or
`rasa run actions --actions actions`) if a requested module under the
`--actions` command-line option cannot be found.

## [1.8.1] - 2020-03-09

### Bugfixes


* [#153](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/153): Make it possible to use the `requests` library inside the default Rasa SDK container.

## [1.8.0] - 2020-02-26

### Improvements


* [#130](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/130): Copied over instance methods `last_executed_action_has()`, `get_last_event_for()` and
  `applied_events` from the Rasa `DialogueStateTracker` class to the SDK `Tracker` class.


* [#145](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/145): Add `poetry` for dependency management and reduce the size of Docker image.

### Miscellaneous internal changes


* #148, #149

## [1.7.0] - 2020-01-29

### Improvements


* `ReminderScheduled` and `ReminderCancelled` now take `intent` and `entities`
as options, instead of `action`. This is because starting with Rasa 1.7 reminders
trigger intents (with entities) instead of actions.


* The following `FormAction` methods are now `async` by default: `validate_slots`,
`validate`, `submit` and `run`. User-defined classes inheriting from
`FormAction` should be adapted to use `async` for these methods. Existing
synchronous implementations will continue to work as normal, but this behaviour will
be deprecated in the future.


* The following `ActionQueryKnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
`utter_objects` and `run`.


* The following `KnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
`get_attributes_of_object`, `get_key_attribute_of_object`,
`get_representation_function_of_object`, `get_objects` and `get_object`. Same
warning for `FormAction` applies here - user-defined classes should be updated to
use `async`, but will continue to work for the moment.


* The following `InMemoryKnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
  `get_attributes_of_object`, `get_objects` and `get_object`.

methods can do.


* The `CollectingDispatcher` methods `utter_custom_message`, `utter_elements`,
`utter_button_message`, `utter_attachment`, `utter_button_template`,
`utter_template`, `utter_custom_json` and `utter_image_url` were deprecated in
