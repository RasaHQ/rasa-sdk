## [3.10.0] - 2024-09-04
                        
Rasa_Sdk 3.10.0 (2024-09-04)                             
### Improvements
- [#1122](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/1122): Added `--actions-module` argument for specifying the custom actions path, prioritizing it over the soon-to-be-deprecated `--actions` argument.

### Miscellaneous internal changes

- [#1123](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/1123), [#1130](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/1130)


## [3.9.0] - 2024-07-03
                       
Rasa_Sdk 3.9.0 (2024-07-03)                            
### Features
- [#1109](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/1109): Rasa SDK now supports gRPC protocol. 
  This allows users to use gRPC to invoke custom actions.
  Users can use secure (TLS) and insecure connections to communicate over gRPC.
  To start action server with gRPC use `--grpc` flag.
  For SSL support, users can provide `--ssl-keyfile`,  `--ssl-certificate` and `--ssl-ca-file`.
  Support for `--ssl-password` is not available yet due to a limitation in the gRPC Python library.

### Bugfixes
- [#1117](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/1117): Tracing is supported for actions called over gRPC protocol.

### Bugfixes
- [#1219](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/1219): The logger for rasa_sdk plugin will not throw traceback when no plugins are found since plugins are optional. It will be only available in debug mode, however the action server will continue to run.


## [3.6.0] - 2023-06-13
                       
Rasa_Sdk 3.6.0 (2023-06-13)                            
### Deprecations and Removals
- [#975](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/975): Drop support for Python 3.7 as [it is approaching its end of life in June 2023](https://peps.python.org/pep-0537/#lifespan).

### Features
- [#970](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/970): Add pluggy to provide ability to create sanic extensions in rasa-sdk

### Improvements
- [#922](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/922): ## Problem
  Rasa knowledge base actions cannot infer the object type of an object directly from the user message without the user first asking to list all objects related to that object type. This prevents action_query_knowledge from providing a suitable response when a user asks for a certain attribute of an object even though the knowledge base has the relevant information. That is, the knowledge base actions require the slot `object_type` to be set to one of the primary key values in the knowledge base for it to search through the objects. Here is an example:
  ```
  Your input ->  what is the price range of Berlin Burrito Company?
  Sorry, I'm not sure I understand. Can you rephrase?
  Your input ->  list some restaurants
  Found the following objects of type 'restaurant':
  1: Gong Gan
  2: I due forni
  3: Pfefferberg
  4: Lụa Restaurant
  5: Donath
  Your input ->  what is the price range of Berlin Burrito Company?
  'Berlin Burrito Company' has the value 'cheap' for attribute 'price-range'.
  ```

  ## Proposed solution
  - The improvement requires changes to the classes ActionQueryKnowledgeBase and InMemoryKnowledgeBase under rasa-sdk. 
  - The `object_type` can be inferred by  utilizing the entity extraction (DIET) where object types are used as entities to annotate object names. 
  This also requires changes to be made to slot management to enable dynamic inference of `object_type`. 
  - The scope of the suggested solution is limited to user queries where they ask for an attribute of a given object without mentioning the object type and without needing to first ask for a list of options of the corresponding object type. 
  - E.g.: If the user asks for ‘price range of Berlin Burrito Company’, then rasa will extract and set attribute slot value to ‘price-range’ and hotel slot value to ‘Berlin Burrito Company’. From this, it can be inferred that the user is talking about the object type ‘hotel’. 

  ## Summary of Changes
  - To enable the inference of `object_type` using the entities the following changes were made to the existing code base:
      - Extract the list of object_types from our knowledge base using a new method `get_object_types()` in `storage.py` for the `InMemoryKnowledgeBase` class. 
      - A new method named `match_extracted_entities_to_object_type()` was added in `utils.py` to infer the object type of a given object using the entities and list of object types
      - The relevant logic was added in `actions.py` to infer the object type using the above functionalities when the object type slot is not set. 
      - To enable dynamic inference of `object_type`, changes to slot management are also required. Currently, the change is to reset the `object_type` slot to `None` after every conversation turn.

  Minor dependency updates

- [#8223](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/8223): `utter_message` in `CollectingDispatcher` now explicitly takes in both `response` and `template`. Note that the parameter `template` will be deprecated in Rasa SDK 3.0.0. Please use `dispatcher.utter_message(response=...)` instead.

## [2.4.0] - 2021-03-11

### Bugfixes

- [#406](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/406): Fix bug where ActionQueryKnowledgeBase incorrectly issues a template message with the string representation of the function for getting the string representation of the knowledge base item and not the actual string representation of the knowledge base item.

  For example, before the fix, the query knowledge base demo bot would utter this

  ```
  '<function ActionMyKB.init.. at 0x7fb23b7fddd0>' has the value 'True' for attribute 'breakfast-included'.
  ```

  instead of this:

  ```
  'Hilton (Berlin)' has the value 'True' for attribute 'breakfast-included'.
  ```

## [2.2.0] - 2020-12-15

No significant changes.

## [2.1.2] - 2020-11-19

No significant changes.

## [2.1.1] - 2020-11-17

### Bugfixes

- [#344](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/344): Fix a bug in the `FormValidationAction` which immediately deactivated the form.

## [2.1.0] - 2020-11-17

### Features

- [#329](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/329): Extend `FormValidationAction` with support for extracting slots. If you
  want to extract an additional slot, add the slot's name to the list of `required_slots`
  and add a method `extract_<slot name>` to your action:

```python
  from typing import Text, Dict, Any, List, Optional

  from rasa_sdk.forms import (
      FormValidationAction,
  )

  class FormWithSlotExtractions(FormValidationAction):
      def name(self) -> Text:
          return "some_form"

      async def required_slots(
          self,
          slots_mapped_in_domain: List[Text],
          dispatcher: "CollectingDispatcher",
          tracker: "Tracker",
          domain: "DomainDict",
      ) -> Optional[List[Text]]:
          return slots_mapped_in_domain + ["my_slot"]

      async def extract_my_slot(
          self,
          dispatcher: "CollectingDispatcher",
          tracker: "Tracker",
          domain: "DomainDict",
      ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
          return {"my_slot": "some value"}
```

If all slots returned by `required_slots` are filled,
the action will automatically return an event to disable the form.
If not all required slots are filled, the SDK will return an event
to Rasa Open Source to fill the first missing slot next.

### Improvements

- [#7078](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/7078): Adds the method `get_intent_of_latest_message` to the `Tracker` allowing easier
  access to the user's latest intent in case of an `nlu_fallback`.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-10-07

### Deprecations and Removals

- [#246](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/246): Using the `Form` event is
  deprecated. Please use the new `ActiveLoop` event instead.
  Using the `active_form` property of the `Tracker` object is now deprecated. Please
  use the `active_loop` property instead.

  The usage of the `FormAction` is deprecated. Please see the migration guide
  for Rasa Open Source 2.0 for instructions how to migrate your `FormAction`s.

- [#250](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/250): Removed support for the
  `rasa_core_sdk` python module: use `import rasa_sdk` syntax instead.
- [#6463](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/6463): The `FormValidation` event
  was renamed to `LoopInterrupted` as part of Rasa Open Source 2.0. Using the
  `FormValidation` is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  Please use `LoopInterrupted` instead.

### Features

- [#238](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/238): Added the method
  `slots_to_validate` to `Tracker`. This method is helpful
  when using a custom action to validate slots which were extracted by a
  form as shown by the following example.

  ```python
  from typing import Text, Dict, List, Any
  from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
  from rasa_sdk.events import EventType, SlotSet
  from rasa_sdk.types import DomainDict
  from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher

  class ValidateSlots(Action):
      def name(self) -> Text:
          return "validate_your_form"

      def run(
          self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: DomainDict
      ) -> List[EventType]:
          extracted_slots: Dict[Text, Any] = tracker.slots_to_validate()

          validation_events = []

          for slot_name, slot_value in extracted_slots.items():
              # Check if slot is valid.
              if self.is_valid(slot_value):
                  validation_events.append(SlotSet(slot_name, slot_value))
              else:
                  # Return a `SlotSet` event with value `None` to indicate that this
                  # slot still needs to be filled.
                  validation_events.append(SlotSet(slot_name, None))

          return validation_events

      def is_valid(self, slot_value: Any) -> bool:
          # Implementation of the validate function.
        return True
  ```

  Please note that `tracker.form_slots_to_validate` only works with Rasa Open Source 2.

### Improvements

- [#239](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/239): Validate user input during
  form activation even if there is an action in between.
- [#246](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/246): Rasa Open Source 2.0 renamed
  the `Form` event to `ActiveLoop`. The `ActiveLoop`
  event was added to the SDK and support for the `active_loop` field in JSON payloads
  was added.
- [#267](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/267): The `actions` package
  in a Rasa project may contain multiple files containing custom
  action code. The Rasa SDK Docker container now loads the entire `actions` package.
- [#288](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/288): Add the `FormValidationAction`
  abstract class that can be used to validate slots which were extracted by a Form.

  Example:

```python
  from typing import Text, Any, Dict
  from rasa_sdk import FormValidationAction, Tracker
  from rasa_sdk.types import DomainDict
  from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher

  class MyFormValidationAction(FormValidationAction):
      def name(self) -> Text:
          return "some_form"

      def validate_slot1(
          self,
          slot_value: Any,
          dispatcher: "CollectingDispatcher",
          tracker: "Tracker",
          domain: "DomainDict",
      ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
          if slot_value == "correct_value":
              return {
                  "slot1": "validated_value",
              }
          return {
              "slot1": None,
          }
```

- [#6463](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/6463): Added support for the
  `LoopInterrupted` event.

### Bugfixes

- [#164](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-sdk/pull/164): Added new `--auto-reload` CLI argument. When specified, modules containing `Action`
  subclasses will be automatically reloaded if they have been modified since the last HTTP
  request. By using this, one can avoid having to re-start the actions server when
  developing new actions.

- [#3765](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/3765): Add support for entities with role and group labels.

  If you use `from_entity` in your custom slot mapping, you can now also specify a role and group label.
  If you set a role or group label, the slot is only filled if the entity has the specific role or group label set.
  If you don’t specify a role or group label, the function behaves as before.

### Improvements

- [#176](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/176): The Rasa SDK image now uses Python 3.7 instead of Python 3.6.

### Bugfixes

- [#176](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/176): Updated `pyyaml` dependency to `5.3.1` to fix
  [CVE-2020-1747](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1747)

## [1.9.0] - 2020-03-24

### Bugfixes

- [#110](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/110): Exit program (`python -m rasa_sdk --actions actions` or
  `rasa run actions --actions actions`) if a requested module under the
  `--actions` command-line option cannot be found.

## [1.8.1] - 2020-03-09

### Bugfixes

- [#153](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/153): Make it possible to use the `requests` library inside the default Rasa SDK container.

## [1.8.0] - 2020-02-26

### Improvements

- [#130](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/130): Copied over instance methods `last_executed_action_has()`, `get_last_event_for()` and
  `applied_events` from the Rasa `DialogueStateTracker` class to the SDK `Tracker` class.

- [#145](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/145): Add `poetry` for dependency management and reduce the size of Docker image.

### Miscellaneous internal changes

- #148, #149

## [1.7.0] - 2020-01-29

### Improvements

- `ReminderScheduled` and `ReminderCancelled` now take `intent` and `entities`
  as options, instead of `action`. This is because starting with Rasa 1.7 reminders
  trigger intents (with entities) instead of actions.

- The following `FormAction` methods are now `async` by default: `validate_slots`,
  `validate`, `submit` and `run`. User-defined classes inheriting from
  `FormAction` should be adapted to use `async` for these methods. Existing
  synchronous implementations will continue to work as normal, but this behaviour will
  be deprecated in the future.

- The following `ActionQueryKnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
  `utter_objects` and `run`.

- The following `KnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
  `get_attributes_of_object`, `get_key_attribute_of_object`,
  `get_representation_function_of_object`, `get_objects` and `get_object`. Same
  warning for `FormAction` applies here - user-defined classes should be updated to
  use `async`, but will continue to work for the moment.

- The following `InMemoryKnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
  `get_attributes_of_object`, `get_objects` and `get_object`.
