Rasa communicates with the action server via REST calls. An action server
must implement a `/webhook` endpoint that accepts a `POST` request a JSON payload,
and returns a JSON payload of [events](events.mdx) and [responses](actions.mdx#responses).
The [API spec](api-spec.mdx) specifies the request and response format.

Rasa SDK implements the `/webhook` endpoint as well as two others, `/health`,
which returns the action server status, and `/actions`, which returns a list 
of all possible actions. 
If you build your own action server, you can implement whichever endpoints you like
in addition to `/webhook`.
