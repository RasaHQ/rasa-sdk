A dispatcher is an instance of the `CollectingDispatcher` class used to generate responses to send back to the user.

## CollectingDispatcher

`CollectingDispatcher` has one method, `utter_message`, and one attribute, `messages`.
It is used in an action's `run` method to add responses to the payload returned to the Rasa server. 
The Rasa server will in turn add `BotUttered` events to the tracker for each response. Responses
added using the dispatcher should therefore not be returned
explicitly as [events](events.mdx). For example, the 
following custom action returns no events explicitly but will return the response, "Hi, User!" to the user:

```python
class ActionGreetUser(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_greet_user"

    async def run(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[EventType]:

        dispatcher.utter_message(text = "Hi, User!")

        return []
```


### CollectingDispatcher.utter_message

The `utter_message` method can be used to return any type 
of response to the user. 

#### **Parameters**

The `utter_message` method takes the following optional arguments. 
Passing no arguments will result in an empty message being returned to the user. 
Passing multiple arguments will result in a rich response (e.g. text and buttons) being returned to the user.

  - `text`: The text to return to the user.

  ```python
  dispatcher.utter_message(text = "Hey there")
  ```
 
  - `image`: An image URL or file path that will be used to display an image to the user.

  ```python
  dispatcher.utter_message(image = "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg")
  ```

  - `json_message`: A custom json payload as a dictionary. It can be used to send [channel specific responses](http://rasa.com/docs/rasa/responses).
                  The following example would return a date picker in Slack:

  ```python
  date_picker = {
    "blocks":[
      {
        "type": "section",
        "text":{
          "text": "Make a bet on when the world will end:",
          "type": "mrkdwn"
        },
        "accessory":
        {
          "type": "datepicker",
          "initial_date": "2019-05-21",
          "placeholder":
          {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "Select a date"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  dispatcher.utter_message(json_message = date_picker)
  ```

  - `template`: The name of a response template to return to the user. This response template should
              be specified in your assistants [domain](http://rasa.com/docs/rasa/domain).

  ```python
  dispatcher.utter_message(template = "utter_greet")
  ```

  - `attachment`: A URL or file path of an attachment to return to the user.

  ```python
  dispatcher.utter_message(attachment = "")
  ```

  - `buttons`: A list of buttons to return to the user. 
             Each button is a dictionary and should have a `title` and a `payload` key. 
             A button can include other keys, but these will only be used if
             a specific channel looks for them.
             The button's `payload` will be sent as a user message if the user
             clicks the button.

  ```
  dispatcher.utter_message(buttons = [
                  {"payload": "/affirm", "title": "Yes"},
                  {"payload": "/deny", "title": "No"},
              ])
  ```

  - `elements`: These are specific to using Facebook as a messaging channel. For details 
              of expected format see [Facebook's documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/template/generic/)

  - `**kwargs`: arbitrary keyword arguments, which can be 
              used to specify values for [variable interpolation in response variations](http://rasa.com/docs/rasa/responses). For example, 
              given the following response template:

  ```yaml
  responses:
    utter_greet_name:
    - text: Hi {name}!
  ```

  You could specify the name with:

  ```python
  dispatcher.utter_message(template = "utter_greet_name", name = "Aimee")
  ```

#### **Return type**

`None`
