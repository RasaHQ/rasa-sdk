Updated the following dependencies

```
opentelemetry-sdk = "~1.33.0"
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp = "~1.33.0"
opentelemetry-api = "~1.33.0"
protobuf = "~5.29.5"
```

and removed the dependency

```
opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger
```

in order to add support for python 3.13.

We also updated the `JaegerTracerConfigurer`
as we are now using the native support of OTLP.
